## 📌 About

**Guessemon** is a Pokémon-inspired guessing game built as a web app.  
You try to guess a Pokémon based on the information and feedback you get after each attempt, aiming to find the correct answer in as few guesses as possible.

This project is a way for me to practice:

- Modern React + TypeScript
- Working with APIs / data
- Front-end project structure and deployment

## ✨ Features
